                      The purpose of this research project is to examine the potential of using speculative storywriting to explore the long-term impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on future education contexts. Writing speculative stories helps us build alternative, (un)wanted education spaces or scenarios, offering insights that can inform present decisions and outlooks.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      You are invited to participate by contributing your own speculative story. Your participation will help us better understand various visions of future learning environments shaped by AI.

                    <h3 className="font-bold text-base mt-4">Project Methodology and Specifications</h3>
                    <p>
                      As part of this project, you will use a digital interactive scenario generator tool. Upon agreeing to participate, you will be prompted to generate four distinct elements from a digital card deck. These elements form the basis for a speculative story, which you will write in the space provided within the tool. You may also find prompts, examples, and guiding questions to support your writing process.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      After completing your story, you will have the option to "submit" it to a connected form. This form will also include fields for demographic information, such as your occupation, subject field, and country, as well as an optional email address field.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 className="font-bold text-base mt-4">Information Collection</h3>
                    <p>
                      Within this research project, we will collect and register the following:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                      <li>Written/generated story: The story you create is stored separately and will not be connected to any identifying personal information (unless you choose to provide such information in the form).</li>
                      <li>Email address (optional): Only if you choose to provide it.</li>
                      <li>Occupation, subject field, and country: General demographic information that helps us gauge the audience using the tool.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                      The submitted stories and your feedback will be analyzed as part of the research project. Portions of these stories may also be cited or discussed in research publications and presentations, or used in subsequent focus groups or workshop discussions. However, no identifying information will be included in such discussions.
